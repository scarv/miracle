# MIRACLE: MIcRo-ArChitectural Leakage Evaluation

<!--- -------------------------------------------------------------------- --->

*Acting as a component part of the wider
[SCARV](https://www.scarv.org)
project,
MIRACLE captures a range of components that relate to the study of 
micro-architectural side-channel leakage, i.e., leakage that stems
from micro-architectural behaviour.  Specifically, there are three
main components, namely
a suite of software kernels, specifically constructed to assess
whether or not a given form of leakage is evident;
a framework for executing such kernels and acquiring associated
data sets, e.g., traces of power consumption;
and
a framework for analysing such data sets, and then presenting 
the results (via a web-based front-end).*
