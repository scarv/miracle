# STM ARM M0 Board / STM32F4 @16MHz

This target analyses an ST Microelectronics `STM32F405 RGT6` SoC using the
[ChipWhisperer CW308](https://wiki.newae.com/CW308_UFO_Target)
platform from
[NewAE](https://newae.com).

The SoC contains an ARM M4 micro-processor, 512Kb of SRAM and 1Mb of flash.
It uses an AHB main bus to talk to the memory, and a AHB-APB Bridge to
talk to peripheral devices.

## Getting Started

### Setting up the ChipWhisperer:

Oscillator Frequency: `7.37 MHz`

Board setup:

### Running an Experiment:

To build and run an experiment on the target:

```
$> source bin/conf.sh
$> export UAS_ARM_TOOLCHAIN_ROOT=<path to 2016q3 ARM embedded toolchain>
$> make -B PROGRAM_WITH_OPENOCD=1 USB_BAUD=38400 UAS_TARGET=cw308_stm32f4 flow-pipeline-regs-xor-lhs
```

@note The USB_BAUD rate for this target is `38400`.

If you're target device is not connected to `/dev/ttyUSB0`, you also need
to specify `USB_PORT=<port path>`.
