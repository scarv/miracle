@brief Replicate the secure store-after-store countermeasure from the ROSITA paper.

@note This experiment is based on the paper
    "ROSITA: Towards Automatic Elimination of Power-Analysis Leakage in
    Ciphers" by Shelton et al.

## Running the experiment

To run all stages of the experiment for a particular target device:

```
make -B USB_PORT=[PORT] UAS_TARGET=[TARGET] flow-rosita-st-st
```

Where:
- `[PORT]` Is the UART/Serial port to communicate with it over.
- `[TARGET]` Is one of the target names listed in @ref targets

This will run all of the build, program, capture and analyse steps for
the experiment on the specified target.

The individual steps of the experiment are run with the following commands:

- Build: `make build_[TARGET]_rosita-st-st`
- Program: `make program_[TARGET]_rosita-st-st`
- Capture: `make capture_[TARGET]_rosita-st-st USB_PORT=[PORT]`
- Analyse: `make analyse_[TARGET]_rosita-st-st`
